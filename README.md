Zxv's custom fork of Trimps
===

My custom fork of [Trimps](https://github.com/Trimps/Trimps.github.io). The main purpose is to implement a few personal features that haven't been added to the main game yet.

No major gameplay differences will exist on this fork (yet ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)). Changes are only cosmetic.

# Version information: 
* Current game version: 5.3.9
* Current fork version: 1.1

# Wishlist:
* Add button which allows the user to select which mods to load, and store the user's selection in local storage.
* Overhaul equality slider to be much more responsive (possibly predictive).

# Implemented changes:
* Added the ability to combine multiple compatible dailies.
* Fixed a few minor graphical glitches
* Added a custom function which allows for easy overwriting of base game functions
* Added the ability to recolour cells which contain fast enemies in maps.
