Zxv's custom fork of Trimps
===

My custom fork of [Trimps](https://github.com/Trimps/Trimps.github.io). The main purpose is to implement a few personal features that haven't been added to the main game yet.

No major gameplay differences will exist on this fork (yet ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)). Changes are only cosmetic.

# Version information: 
* Current game version: 4.10.2
* Current fork version: 0.0

# Wishlist:
* Add support for 5 presets
* Custom number formatting
* Mobile friendly layout

# Implemented changes:
